A simple Live Schedule application that supports Dark Mode and PWA and auto updations.

Key features:
* Live Schedule
* Progressive Web Apps (PWA)
* Dark Mode Support
* Auto-refresh to automatically update the events


Credits : The application is developed by <a href="https://github.com/limhenry">Henry Lim</a>. I just added PWA, Dark Mode and Auto Updation onto the top of his code.
